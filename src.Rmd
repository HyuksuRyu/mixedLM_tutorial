When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

# Linear model
## Setting data frame

```{r}
pitch = c(233, 204, 242, 130, 112, 142)
sex = c(rep("female", 3), rep("male", 3))
my.df = data.frame(sex, pitch) # data frame of 6 informants
my.df
```

----
## Linear model
- Linear model
```{r}
xmdl = lm(pitch ~ sex, my.df)
summary(xmdl)
```

```{r}
mean(my.df[my.df$sex=="female",]$pitch)
```
